## ZIO SBT Website

ZIO SBT Website is an SBT plugin that has the following tasks:

- `sbt compileDocs`— compile documentation inside `docs` directory. The compilation result will be inside `website/docs` directory.
- `sbt installWebsite`— creates a website for the project inside the `website` directory.
- `sbt previewWebsite`— runs a local webserver that serves documentation locally on http://localhost:3000. By changing the documentation inside the `docs` directory, the website will be reloaded with new content.
- `sbt publishToNpm`— publishes documentation inside the `docs` directory to the npm registry.
- `sbt generateGithubWorkflow`— generates GitHub workflow which publishes documentation for each library release.
- `sbt generateReadme`— generate README.md file from `docs/index.md` and sbt setting keys.
